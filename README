Quickly create static websites using Google App Engine with Python and Django templates.

1. Create your application in GAE
2. Set your application name in app.yaml
3. Change some settings in main.py (eg. admin e-mail address)
4. Edit "templates/base.html" to suit your needs. This will be the base template that all others extend (if you want)
5. Create a new template for each page you want. For example, templates/news.html is matched with /news/; templates/news/0001.html is matched with /news/0001/ and so on.
6. Static media (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc) goes to /static/
7. Publish to GAE
